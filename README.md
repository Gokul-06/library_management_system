# library_management_system


A library's core administrative tasks are managed by a software program called a library management system. Systems for managing libraries' asset collections and interactions with patrons are essential. Libraries can keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as the subscriptions and profiles of members, thanks to library management systems. The upkeep of the database used to enter new books and track borrowed books with their due dates is another aspect of library management systems.
